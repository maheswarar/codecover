Kube-apiserver private endpoint: This endpoint is used for internal communication within the AKS cluster. It provides a secure and isolated entry point for components within the cluster to interact with the Kubernetes API server, which serves as the control plane for managing the cluster.
the kube-apiserver private endpoint is primarily used for communication within the AKS cluster itself,
Within the private AKS cluster, various components such as worker nodes, control plane components (like the scheduler and controller manager), and add-ons need to communicate with the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver) to perform their respective functions. They use the kube-apiserver private endpoint as the entry point for this communication
